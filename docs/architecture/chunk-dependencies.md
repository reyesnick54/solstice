# Chunk and capability dependencies

Build chunks declare the capabilities they need. The architecture
tooling answers whether each required capability is:

- `IMPLEMENTED` — present on `main` with a canonical owner
- `PARTIAL` — reserved owner exists; the capability is incomplete
- `PLANNED` — reserved in the manifest; not implemented
- `ABSENT` — not in the manifest at all

## Rule

If a task requires a **protected** dependency that is not
`IMPLEMENTED` on `main`, the agent must **stop** rather than
independently reimplementing the missing subsystem.

That rule exists so a later-phase agent cannot decide:

> Phase 8 is absent, so I will create my own Phase 8.

Absence is not permission to fork. The agent updates nothing, invents
no second Kernel / ledger / Money / Evidence Vault / ActionIntent /
account-class taxonomy, and reports the missing capability.

## How to declare a chunk

Add a JSON file under `docs/architecture/chunks/`:

```json
{
  "chunk": "CHUNK-9",
  "title": "Example later chunk",
  "requires": ["persistence", "identity", "policy-engine"]
}
```

`requires` entries are capability ids from
[`manifest.json`](./manifest.json) `capabilities`.

The architectural linter loads every `docs/architecture/chunks/*.json`
file and records each requirement's status. Declaring a future chunk
that requires a `PLANNED` capability does **not** fail CI. Implementing
a competing owner for an already-protected capability does.

## Evaluator

`evaluateChunkRequirements(manifest, requires)` in
`tools/architectural-linter` returns per-capability status and
`mustStop: true` when any **protected** requirement is not
`IMPLEMENTED`.

Agents and later CI jobs use that result. They do not guess.

Chunk 6 implements the policy engine inside `packages/kernel`. It does
not reimplement identity. Customer KYC status and residency remain the
identity facts the engine consumes.

Chunk 7 owns screening, AML, fraud, velocity, and cases inside
`packages/kernel/src/compliance`. It does not create `packages/compliance`
or a second Kernel. Simulation adapters only.

Chunk 12 (mobile wallet provisioning and merchant Tap-to-Pay / SoftPOS)
initially stopped because the protected `cards` capability was
`PLANNED`. Cards is now `IMPLEMENTED`. Chunk 12 was subsequently
resumed inside `packages/cards` / `services/cards`. The evaluator
returns `mustStop: false`. Historical stop:
[`chunk-12-stop.md`](./chunk-12-stop.md). Resume:
[`chunk-12-resume.md`](./chunk-12-resume.md). Do not invent a second
cards domain.

Chunk 13 (treasury / liquidity / routing intelligence) initially
stopped on a process gate while Chunk 12 was not yet genuinely
implemented and `main` CI was red. That stop is historical:
[`chunk-13-stop.md`](./chunk-13-stop.md). Chunk 13 is now resumed at
the reserved owners `packages/treasury` and `services/treasury`.
Capability `treasury` is `IMPLEMENTED`. Bounded context TREASURY is
`PARTIAL` simulation. Resume:
[`chunk-13-resume.md`](./chunk-13-resume.md). Do not create
`packages/liquidity`, `packages/routing-intelligence`,
`packages/treasury-core`, or `packages/settlement-risk`.

Chunk 14 implements the Personal Economic Graph as the first SFF 2.0
intelligence layer. It does not start the Personal Economy Agent.
The evaluator returns `mustStop: false`.

Chunk 15 (Personal Economy Agent) originally stopped while `treasury`
was `PLANNED` and `main` CI was red. That stop is historical:
[`chunk-15-stop.md`](./chunk-15-stop.md). Treasury is now
`IMPLEMENTED`. The Personal Economy Agent lives at `packages/agent`
as a proposal-only interpreter. The evaluator returns
`mustStop: false`.

Chunk 16 implements machine-verifiable economic mandates and the
Growth Orchestrator at `packages/platform`. It does not execute
investments and does not start the Personal Economic Value Engine.

Chunk 17 implements the Personal Economic Value Engine at
`packages/platform/src/value`. It extends platform ownership rather
than creating `packages/value-engine`. Capability
`personal-economic-value-engine` is `IMPLEMENTED`.
than creating `packages/value-engine`. It does not start the
Regulatory Digital Twin. The evaluator returns `mustStop: false`.

Chunk 18 implements the Regulatory Digital Twin at
`packages/regulatory-twin`. It reuses the existing policy engine and
Kernel. It does not issue Execution Authority, post journals, or
activate candidate packs. Capability `regulatory-digital-twin` is
`IMPLEMENTED`.
activate candidate packs. The evaluator returns `mustStop: false`.

Chunk 19 implements the reserved INVESTMENTS bounded context at
`packages/investments` and `services/investments`. Capability
`investments` is `IMPLEMENTED`. Bounded context INVESTMENTS is
`PARTIAL` simulation: paper orders, positions, lots, valuation, and
reconciliation only. No live broker. Pre-trade Risk is required.
Do not create `packages/brokerage`, `packages/portfolio`,
`packages/trading`, `packages/wealth`, or `packages/securities-core`.

Chunk 22 (Strategy Lab) is **stopped**. Protected capabilities
`risk`, `model-registry`, and `agentic-capital-mesh` are `PLANNED`.
Chunk 21 is not merged. The evaluator returns `mustStop: true`.
`STRATEGY_LAB` is reserved at `packages/strategy-lab` and
`services/strategy-lab`. Historical stop:
[`chunk-22-stop.md`](./chunk-22-stop.md). Do not create
`packages/backtest`, `packages/trading-lab`, `packages/quant`, or
`packages/strategy-v2`.
Chunk 21 (Agentic Capital Mesh) is **stopped**. Protected capabilities
`risk` and `model-registry` are `PLANNED`. The evaluator returns
`mustStop: true`. See [`chunk-21-stop.md`](./chunk-21-stop.md).
Do not create `packages/agentic-capital-mesh` or competing
`trading-agents` / `investment-agents` / `hedge-agent` / `capital-ai`
packages until Chunk 20 lands those owners as `IMPLEMENTED`.
Chunk 20 implements the reserved RISK and MODEL_REGISTRY bounded
contexts at `packages/risk` and `packages/model-registry`. Capability
`risk` and `model-registry` are `IMPLEMENTED`. Risk supplies
deterministic paper-portfolio facts to the existing Kernel Risk proof.
It does not issue Execution Authority or post journals. Model Registry
is simulation-approval only; there is no `LIVE_APPROVED`. Do not create
`packages/investment-risk`, `packages/risk-v2`,
`packages/portfolio-risk`, `packages/models`, or
`packages/model-governance-v2`. The evaluator returns `mustStop: false`.
