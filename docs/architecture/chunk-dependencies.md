# Chunk and capability dependencies

Build chunks declare the capabilities they need. The architecture
tooling answers whether each required capability is:

- `IMPLEMENTED` — present on `main` with a canonical owner
- `PARTIAL` — reserved owner exists; the capability is incomplete
- `PLANNED` — reserved in the manifest; not implemented
- `ABSENT` — not in the manifest at all

## Rule

If a task requires a **protected** dependency that is not
`IMPLEMENTED` on `main`, the agent must **stop** rather than
independently reimplementing the missing subsystem.

That rule exists so a later-phase agent cannot decide:

> Phase 8 is absent, so I will create my own Phase 8.

Absence is not permission to fork. The agent updates nothing, invents
no second Kernel / ledger / Money / Evidence Vault / ActionIntent /
account-class taxonomy, and reports the missing capability.

## How to declare a chunk

Add a JSON file under `docs/architecture/chunks/`:

```json
{
  "chunk": "CHUNK-9",
  "title": "Example later chunk",
  "requires": ["persistence", "identity", "policy-engine"]
}
```

`requires` entries are capability ids from
[`manifest.json`](./manifest.json) `capabilities`.

The architectural linter loads every `docs/architecture/chunks/*.json`
file and records each requirement's status. Declaring a future chunk
that requires a `PLANNED` capability does **not** fail CI. Implementing
a competing owner for an already-protected capability does.

## Evaluator

`evaluateChunkRequirements(manifest, requires)` in
`tools/architectural-linter` returns per-capability status and
`mustStop: true` when any **protected** requirement is not
`IMPLEMENTED`.

Agents and later CI jobs use that result. They do not guess.

## Current capabilities

| Capability | Status | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| money | IMPLEMENTED | packages/money |
| domain | IMPLEMENTED | packages/domain |
| permissions | IMPLEMENTED | packages/permissions |
| kernel | IMPLEMENTED | packages/kernel |
| ledger | IMPLEMENTED | packages/ledger |
| evidence | IMPLEMENTED | packages/evidence |
| events | IMPLEMENTED | packages/events |
| event-fabric | IMPLEMENTED | packages/events |
| config | IMPLEMENTED | packages/config |
| accounts-service | IMPLEMENTED | services/accounts |
| architecture-linting | IMPLEMENTED | tools/architectural-linter |
| persistence | IMPLEMENTED | packages/persistence |
| security | IMPLEMENTED | packages/security |
| identity | IMPLEMENTED | packages/identity |
| policy-engine | IMPLEMENTED | packages/kernel |
| banking-core | IMPLEMENTED | services/accounts |
| compliance-screening | IMPLEMENTED | packages/kernel |
| payments | IMPLEMENTED | packages/payments |
| fx | IMPLEMENTED | packages/payments |
| rail-adapters | IMPLEMENTED | packages/payments |
| cards | IMPLEMENTED | packages/cards |

Chunk 6 implements the policy engine inside `packages/kernel`. It does
not reimplement identity. Customer KYC status and residency remain the
identity facts the engine consumes.

Chunk 7 owns screening, AML, fraud, velocity, and cases inside
`packages/kernel/src/compliance`. It does not create `packages/compliance`
or a second Kernel. Simulation adapters only.

Chunk 12 (mobile wallet provisioning and merchant Tap-to-Pay / SoftPOS)
requires the protected `cards` capability. That capability is
`IMPLEMENTED` on `main` (Chunk 11). The evaluator now returns
`mustStop: false`. Wallet / SoftPOS features were still not built;
see [`chunk-12-stop.md`](./chunk-12-stop.md). Do not invent a second
cards domain.

Chunk 13 (treasury / liquidity / routing intelligence) requires the
protected capabilities listed in
[`chunks/chunk-13-treasury-routing-intelligence.json`](./chunks/chunk-13-treasury-routing-intelligence.json).
Those capabilities are `IMPLEMENTED`, so the evaluator returns
`mustStop: false`. The Chunk 13 **task** still stopped on a process
gate (Chunk 12 not genuinely implemented, build-status still recorded
the Chunk 12 stop, `main` CI red). See
[`chunk-13-stop.md`](./chunk-13-stop.md). Do not create
`packages/treasury` until that gate is green.
`IMPLEMENTED` on `main`. The evaluator returns `mustStop: false`.
Wallet and SoftPOS extend `packages/cards`; they do not invent a
second cards domain. The original stop (Cards was then `PLANNED`) is
preserved in [`chunk-12-stop.md`](./chunk-12-stop.md). The resumed
implementation is recorded in [`chunk-12-resume.md`](./chunk-12-resume.md).
